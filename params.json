{"name":"CλaSH","tagline":"CAES Language for Synchronous Hardware","body":"# Introduction\r\nCλaSH (pronounced ‘clash’) is a functional hardware description language that borrows both its syntax and semantics from the functional programming language Haskell. The merits of using a functional language to describe hardware comes from the fact that combinational circuits can be directly modeled as mathematical functions and that functional languages lend themselves very well at describing and (de-)composing mathematical functions. \r\n\r\nAn experimental version of the new CλaSH compiler and some examples can be found below.  \r\n**!! The compiler and the CλaSH Prelude library are subject to change !!**\r\n\r\n# Installation\r\nBecause the constraint solver for type-level naturals is only included in the upcoming 7.8 release of [**GHC**](http://haskell.org/ghc), installation of **CλaSH** is sadly more involved than a simple `cabal install clash`.\r\nThe instructions for the installation are found below; these instructions assume that no previous versions of **GHC** are present on the system.\r\nIf you want to run **CλaSH** alongside an existing installation of **GHC**, you should investigate solutions such as [stow](http://www.gnu.org/software/stow/‎) or [multi-ghc](https://github.com/spl/multi-ghc).\r\n\r\n1. Install **GHC 7.8-rc1**\r\n   * Download GHC 7.8-rc1 for your platform (See [GHC 7.8-rc1](#ghc_7.8-rc))\r\n   * Unpack (`tar xjf`) the tarball and `cd` to the directory \r\n   * Run `./configure --prefix=<INSTALLDIR>`, where `<INSTALLDIR>` is the directory you want to install GHC\r\n   * Run `make install`\r\n   * Add the `bin` directory of **GHC** to your path: `PATH=<INSTALLDIR>/bin:$PATH`\r\n2. Install the **CλaSH binary**\r\n   * Download the CλaSH binary for your platform (See [CλaSH Binaries](#c%CE%BBash-binaries)) to `$INSTALLDIR/bin` and rename it to `clash`\r\n   * Ensure that it is executable: `chmod +x <INSTALLDIR>/bin/clash`\r\n3. Install the **TH-Lift library**\r\n   * Download the TH-Lift library (See [TH-Lift package](#th-lift-package))\r\n   * Unpack (`tar xzf` / `unzip`) the archive and `cd` to the directory\r\n   * Run: `ghc --make Setup.hs`\r\n   * Run: `./Setup configure --global --prefix=<INSTALLDIR>`, where `<INSTALLDIR>` is the location you installed **GHC**\r\n   * Run: `./Setup build`\r\n   * Run: `./Setup install`\r\n3. Install the **CλaSH prelude library**\r\n   * Download the CλaSH prelude (See [CλaSH Prelude](#c%CE%BBash-prelude))\r\n   * Unpack (`tar xzf` / `unzip`) the archive and `cd` to the directory\r\n   * Run: `ghc --make Setup.hs`\r\n   * Run: `./Setup configure --global --prefix=<INSTALLDIR>`, where `<INSTALLDIR>` is the location you installed **GHC**\r\n   * Run: `./Setup build`\r\n   * Run: `./Setup install`\r\n4. Install the **CλaSH primitive definitions**\r\n   * Download the CλaSH primitives (See [CλaSH Primitive Definitions](#c%CE%BBash-primitive-definitions))\r\n   * Unpack (`tar xzf`) the primitives tarball to `<PRIMDIR>`, where `<PRIMDIR>` is the directory where you want to store the primitive definitions\r\n   * Add a new environment variable (`CLASH_PRIMDIR`) pointing to the `<PRIMDIR>` directory: `export CLASH_PRIMDIR=\"<PRIMDIR>\"`\r\n5. Verify everything is working by:\r\n   * Downloading the [FIR.hs](https://raw.github.com/christiaanb/clash2/master/examples/FIR.hs) example\r\n   * Run: `clash --interactive FIR.hs`\r\n   * Executing the `:vhdl` command, leave the interpreter using `:q`\r\n   * Examine the VHDL code in the `vhdl` directory\r\n\r\n# Downloads \r\n\r\n#### CλaSH Binaries\r\n[Linux (X86_64)](https://www.dropbox.com/s/9fhvv1var3rkamr/clash-linux) (release date: 2014/02/18)  \r\n[OS X (X86_64)](https://www.dropbox.com/s/g5ery3cclv52mnn/clash-darwin) (release date: 2014/02/18)\r\n\r\n### CλaSH Prelude\r\n[All Platforms (.tar.gz)](https://github.com/christiaanb/clash-prelude/tarball/master)  \r\n[All Platforms (.zip)](https://github.com/christiaanb/clash-prelude/zipball/master)\r\n\r\n### CλaSH Primitive Definitions\r\n[primitives.tar.gz](https://www.dropbox.com/s/b1iq0u9a19dnnzm/primitives.tar.gz) (release date: 2014/02/18)\r\n\r\n### GHC 7.8-rc1\r\nhttp://www.haskell.org/ghc/dist/7.8.1-rc1\r\n\r\n### TH-Lift package\r\n[All Platforms (.tar.gz)](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/th-lift-0.6.1/th-lift-0.6.1.tar.gz)\r\n\r\n# Examples\r\n[FIR.hs](https://raw.github.com/christiaanb/clash2/master/examples/FIR.hs)  \r\n[Calculator.hs](https://raw.github.com/christiaanb/clash2/master/examples/Calculator.hs)  \r\n[CalculatorArrow.hs](https://raw.github.com/christiaanb/clash2/master/examples/CalculatorArrow.hs)","google":"UA-42920604-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
