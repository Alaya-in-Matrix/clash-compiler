{"name":"CλaSH","tagline":"CAES Language for Synchronous Hardware","body":"# Introduction\r\nCλaSH (pronounced ‘clash’) is a functional hardware description language that borrows both its syntax and semantics from the functional programming language Haskell. The merits of using a functional language to describe hardware comes from the fact that combinational circuits can be directly modeled as mathematical functions and that functional languages lend themselves very well at describing and (de-)composing mathematical functions. \r\n\r\nAn experimental version of the new CλaSH compiler and some examples can be found below.  \r\n**!! The compiler and the CλaSH Prelude library are subject to change !!**\r\n\r\n# Installation\r\nBecause the constraint solver for type-level naturals is only included in the latest 7.8.1 release of [**GHC**](http://haskell.org/ghc), installation of **CλaSH** is sadly more involved than a simple `cabal install clash`.\r\nThe instructions for the installation are found below; these instructions assume that no previous versions of **GHC** are present on the system.\r\nIf you want to run **CλaSH** alongside an existing installation of **GHC**, you should investigate solutions such as [stow](http://www.gnu.org/software/stow) or [multi-ghc](https://github.com/spl/multi-ghc).\r\n\r\n1. Install **GHC 7.8.1**\r\n   * Download GHC 7.8.1 for your platform (See [GHC 7.8.1](#ghc-781))\r\n   * Unpack (`tar xf`) the tarball and `cd` to the directory \r\n   * Run `./configure --prefix=<INSTALLDIR>`, where `<INSTALLDIR>` is the directory you want to install GHC\r\n   * Run `make install`\r\n   * Add the `bin` directory of **GHC** to your path: `PATH=<INSTALLDIR>/bin:$PATH`\r\n2. Install **Cabal**\r\n   * Download the sources for `cabal` (See [Cabal](#cabal))\r\n   * Unpack (`tar xf`) the archive and `cd` to the directory\r\n   * Run: `sh bootstrap.sh`\r\n   * Follow the instruction to add the `cabal` program to your `PATH`\r\n   * Run: `cabal update`\r\n3. Install **CλaSH**\r\n   * Run `cabal install clash-ghc`\r\n4. Verify everything is working by:\r\n   * Downloading the [FIR.hs](https://raw.github.com/christiaanb/clash2/master/examples/FIR.hs) example\r\n   * Run: `clash --interactive FIR.hs`\r\n   * Executing the `:vhdl` command, leave the interpreter using `:q`\r\n   * Examine the VHDL code in the `vhdl` directory\r\n\r\n# Documentation\r\n[Tutorial](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/clash-prelude/docs/CLaSH-Tutorial.html)  \r\n[Reference documentation](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/clash-prelude)\r\n\r\n# Downloads \r\n\r\n### GHC 7.8.1\r\nhttp://www.haskell.org/ghc/download_ghc_7_8_1\r\n\r\n### Cabal\r\n[All Platforms (.tar.gz)](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/cabal-install-1.18.0.3/cabal-install-1.18.0.3.tar.gz)\r\n\r\n# Examples\r\n[FIR.hs](https://raw.github.com/christiaanb/clash2/master/examples/FIR.hs)  \r\n[Calculator.hs](https://raw.github.com/christiaanb/clash2/master/examples/Calculator.hs)","google":"UA-42920604-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
